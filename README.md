# DB-Custom-Roles
Some roles for DB that don't really fit into any of the other mods.

Requires [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader).

## Lookout (Good/Villager)
Idea from firedragonflare.

Pick a character, learn who that character has affected.

## Rook (Good/Outcast)
Idea from bitterbugthe2nd.

Swaps 2 disguised characters, and tells you which two they swapped.

## Soul Collector (Evil/Apocalypse)
Idea from datlad11.

On game start: Reaps two characters. Reaped characters Register as a Soul Collector.

When you Execute a Good character: Becomes Death. 

### Death (Evil/Apocalypse)
Starts a 20-second timer. Once it runs out, kills all other characters and ends the game.
